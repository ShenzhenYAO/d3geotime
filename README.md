V12
report date are cleaned, using my report date (for each batch of report, the date is the same)
1. the get recent bug is corrected now 

V11

bug: 
1. the getrecent is not correct (report time issue). to fix: only take the last report time (in a batch, use the same reporting time)
2. The timeline bar is wrong, not showing the most recent data.

Rearrange layout
try to fix incomplete loading issue for csv files (not sure if the problem has been solved)

branch v10

branch v9
add functions to download SARS data from WHO
change the handle label (make it align right when reaching the end)
change the function checking the point to stop playing, fixed the original bug (in sliderupdate())

branch v8
adding stacked bars using Tauchart.

branch v7
rearranged legends

as branch v6

work around the bug: on mouseclick, the time inset shift to right:
It is caused by the transform of the time line bar (shift to right for the distance of margin.left)
The following is done to work around the problem:
1. set margin-left of the bigbox div =  50px
2. set margin.left = 0
3. change the handle label's text anchor to 'left'. (That way, the label won't be covered by the left border of the parent svg)
4. shortern the timeline bar, leaving enough space to display the handle label as it moves to the right end.
